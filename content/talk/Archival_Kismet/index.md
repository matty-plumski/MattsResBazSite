summary: The Archival Trace of Malcolm Ross 
abstract: In New Zealand’s relatively brief art history it is hard to imagine there are many figures as intriguing, elusive, or problematic as Malcolm Ross (1948-2003). Although still largely unknown outside a close circle of friends, Ross’s work has, over the past ten years, slowly come to light.

### WHY?

- Intrinsic motivation - website design is fun, academic portfolio site useful for research engagement. 
- Low risk, free-to-fail sandpit
- Excellent way to teach version control - benefits and processes
- Encourages troubleshooting - deploy logs, community fora
- Helps build a community of practice around a common, richly-tooled ecosystem
- Entry-level training that creates a platform for collaboration and further capability development
- Immediacy - live site deployed and first git commit made within minutes

### STATIC TACTICS
#### Using static website workshops to develop capability and collaboration.
Matt Plummer, Victoria University of Wellington

### WHAT?

- Free, static, git-based websites - maintainable and version-controlled
- Based on open source Hugo theme (Academic), tailored for researchers
- Packaged by Wowchemy, deployed by Netlify
- Markdown-based, supports math equations, code-highlighting and diagrams
- Also CSS, HTML, Shortcodes, Front Matter, Config files (yml, toml)

### WHY?

- Intrinsic motivation - website design is fun, academic portfolio site useful for research engagement. 
- Low risk, free-to-fail sandpit
- Excellent way to teach version control - benefits and processes
- Encourages troubleshooting - deploy logs, community fora
- Helps build a community of practice around a common, richly-tooled ecosystem
- Entry-level training that creates a platform for collaboration and further capability development
- Immediacy - live site deployed and first git commit made within minutes

### HOW?

- Carpentries-inspired methodology - sticky notes + formative feedback
- Code-along approach, with clear explanations 
- Help - ratio of instructor to attendees, or supplemented with a helper
- Different levels of skill and experience accommodated
- Peer support
- Repetition and modular, scaffolded approach 
- Paper-based handouts of key information (concept map of components, directory structure of site, Markdown cheat sheet)

---

### FUTURE PLANS

- Formalise lesson template, including learning objectives 
- Foster sustainable, ongoing community of practice
- Offer follow along sessions:
   - Reverting to previous git commits
   - Collaborating with git
   - Advanced styling with CSS
   - More about Front Matter and Shortcodes
   - Decoupling your site from Netlify and adding custom domain

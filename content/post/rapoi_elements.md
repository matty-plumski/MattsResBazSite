# Linking Research outputs to Rāpoi in Elements

**Prerequites** - to complete this process, you'll need to have an Elements profile. Elements is VUW's research management system, and all academic staff should have access by default. If you are a post-graduate student, you may not have a public profile page, but you should still be able to log in with your VUW staff credentials and carry out the process.

For full documentation on Staff Profiles with Elements, see [this page](https://intranet.wgtn.ac.nz/staff/research/using-elements/guide-staff-profiles.pdf). 



1. Log in to Elements (elements.wgtn.ac.nz) and make sure relevant research outputs (funded grant, journal article etc) are present in your Elements profile. If they are not showing, the outputs can be added manually (see [guide pdf, pp 38-39](https://intranet.wgtn.ac.nz/staff/research/using-elements/guide-staff-profiles.pdf)).

3. Navigate to output that's made use of Rāpoi (publication, grant or activity) by clicking on the ```VIEW ALL``` button at the bottom right of each card (e.g. Publication>View All ):

## Morning Session

### Positive feedback
- Very useful, good to be able to switch between different applications, time and space to adapt to own needs
- Was very clear and easy to follow along, even though I was behind initially
- Use of GitHub, telling us to install/prepare beforehand saved a lot of time, great format - learned a lot already
- Really useful, can see how I will use it
- follow along parts useful, good pacing, WordPress critique helpful, ejoyed Q and A breaks a lot (great job!!)
- Good choice of platform, easy to use, good instruction
- Cheatsheet is good, clear and well paced.
- The paper handout with the flow of how parts connect was helpful

### Critical feedback
- a bit messy at times
- Nothing yet 
- The only thing that was slightly unclear to me was: why wowchemy? 
- could be useful to dive into GitHub Desktop for 15-30 minutes
- Digital handout with tools and examples could be cool
- Establish relationship between sites/software at beginning (to better remember where to pick up later)
- Downloading GitHub really worried me - projects, issues etc. Had no idea what I was going to use it for.

## Afternoon Session

### Positive feedback
- Great workshop - very interesting and easy to follow (and fun!). Found it very worthwhile
- Perfect step-by-step instructions / learning by doing approach, really helpful
- The session has been really informative and useful. I've learnt heaps. Can't wait for the next session. Thanks, Matt!!
- I learned it for the first time. Thank you. It was helpful.
- Great pace, great explanation, very well prepared. I fell empowered and really enjoyed this. Thank you!!

### Critical feedback
- I wonder what happens if we push something wrong. Can we retract it at that level. Also, a little intro to command line.
- Follow up notes, hand out of pipeline could be useful. List of options for themes etc. 
- Perhaps include a handout with basic step-by-step instructions of how to set up another website (i.e. steps we did during the first 20 mins or so of the workshop )
- Can't really think of anything . . . maybe sending out a link to what the 'academic' template includes, looks like beforehand so we know what elements to have prepared?

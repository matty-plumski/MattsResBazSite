### Tips
- ALT/CMD + TAB to switch between tabs
- Windows - WINDOWS + Arrow key to split windows
- Add site to Quick Access in File Explorer or Finder (Finder > Preferences > Sidebar,)
- Add site title to Git Repository
- Check netlify.com if changes don't propagate. Look for red error messages to see where the mistake is.
- Use inspect or view page source to see how your, or other webistes, are constructed. 
- Copy and paste code snippets  (e.g. css values)
- save images directly to local folders used for website. 

### Notes

Widely used theme - pros - lots of resources, active community, more likely to be maintained. cons - can look a little generic.

Why use a text editor, rather than microsoft word? MS Word, adds a lot of metadata (AKA crap) to the file. Text editors offer many tools helpful - including highlighting code. It is a different environment, but incredibly useful to know.

### GitHub Desktop
- visual view of changes
- must save file before changes appear
- if more than one file is made, must add a custom message to the commit - this is to help your future self

### Goals
- focus on the content, not the webdesign* (*unless you enjoy this or are looking for some virtuous procrastination)
- understand basics of web markup & design languages and protocols
- understand the affordances and limitations of static sites (e.g. Jekyll, Hugo) vs Databases (Wordpress)
- feel confident to look for anwers online

### Notes

Widely used theme - pros - lots of resources, active community, more likely to be maintained. cons - can look a little generic.

Why use a text editor, rather than microsoft word? MS Word, adds a lot of metadata (AKA crap) to the file. Text editors offer many tools helpful - including highlighting code. It is a different environment, but incredibly useful to know.
